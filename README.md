ML-Deep-Learning Projects Repository

This repository contains various machine learning and deep learning projects that We have worked on. These projects explore different algorithms, techniques, and applications using tools like Python, TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch.

Directory Structure:
- Each project is contained in a separate folder.
- You will find a Python script or Jupyter notebook with the implementation for each project.
- A requirements.txt file that lists all the libraries needed for each project.

How to Use:
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ML-Deep-Learning.git

2. Install necessary libraries using pip:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Navigate to the project folder and run the script or notebook:
   cd project-folder
   python project-script.py (or open project-notebook.ipynb)

Feel free to fork or contribute to this repository.
